function [roll, pitch, yaw, A_g, A_spec] = ...
  calc_rpy_naive(A, M, sample_freq, wd_naive)
% Estimate roll, pitch and yaw of the animal assuming accelerometer
% reading is all about gravity. The input sensor data should be aligned
% with the animal's body frame: x-surge points forward, y-sway points left,
% and z-sway points up. If input is not aligned with the animal's body,
% then this function estimates the rpy of the tag itself rather than the 
% animal.
%
% INPUT:
% A             n-by-3 acceleromter reading [unit does not matter]. 
%               Axes are aligned with the animal's body frame as defined 
%               above.
% M             n-by-3 *calibrated* magnetometer reading [unit does not matter]. 
%               Axes are aligned with the animal's body frame as defined 
%               above.
% sample_freq   1-by-1 scalar, the sampling frequency of the sensor.
% wd_naive      1-by-1 scalar, window size of the (low-pass) moving
%               average filter, used in the naive method for identifying 
%               portion of the signal associated static and dynamic
%               orientation, fitering out linear accelrations. 
%               So the filtered signal is getting closer to the assumption 
%               accelerometer reading is all about gravity. [counts]
%               To start with try: "wd_naive = 0.5 * sample_freq;" 
%
%
% OUTPUT:
% roll          n-by-1 roll angle of the animal in [degree].
%               Roll is defined as the rotation around body forward axis
%               (x-axis). At zero roll, the y-axis has zero gravity
%               reading. Positive roll is body lean to the right.
% pitch         n-by-1 pitch angle of the animal in [degree].
%               Pitch is defined as the angle between body forward axis 
%               (x-axis) and the horizontal plane of the world. 
%               Positive pitch is head up. Note that positive rotation
%               around y-axis in our axes defination is negative pitch. 
% yaw           n-by-1 yaw angle of the animal in [degree]. The direction
%               of magnetic north is yaw 0. West is 90 deg. South is 180.
%               East is -90 deg.
% A_g           n-by-3 accleration measure (static + dynamic) associated 
%               with gravity. [g]
% A_spec        n-by-3 accleration measure associated with (dynamic) linear
%               accleration of the animal. [g]
