function [roll, pitch, yaw, A_g, A_spec, rt, bool_singular] =...
  calc_rpy_magnetometer(A, M, sample_freq, wd_static, wd_naive)
% Estimate roll, pitch and yaw of the animal, with an implementation of the
% "magnetometer method" proposed in [1]. The "magnetometer method" uses 
% magnetometer reading to help identifying dynamic orientation changes  
% associated with the fluking (*pitch*) motion of *cetacean*, hence decouples
% accelerometer reading into: (1) static acc ("A_filt"), (2) dynamic acc 
% induced by linear acceleration of the animal ("A_spec"), (3) dynamic acc
% induced by orientation changes of the animal.
%
% The "magnetometer method" suffers from "singular events" when the y-axis
% (sway) of the animal is colinear with the magnetic field. This
% implementation patches these events (marked by "idx_singular") by
% replacing results of those sections with results from a naive method.
%
% The naive method applies a mild low-pass filter to acceleration
% measurement "A" and assumes the filtered signal "A_g_naive" is associated
% with gravity (contains both static and dynamic orientation of the 
% animal), while all dynamic linear accelration of the animal has been
% filtered out (which is not accurate, but that's why it's called naive).
%
% The input sensor data should be aligned
% with the animal's body frame: x-surge points forward, y-sway points left,
% and z-sway points up. If input is not aligned with the animal's body,
% then this function estimates the rpy of the tag itself rather than the 
% animal.
%
% **NOTE** The "magnetometer method* is making an underlying assumption that
% high frequency motions are results of fluking. Thus the method does not
% handle the situations well when the animal does a quick back-and-forth
% roll or turn.
%
% INPUT:
% A             n-by-3 accelerometer reading [unit does not matter]. 
%               Axes are aligned with the animal's body frame as defined 
%               above.
% M             n-by-3 *calibrated* magnetometer reading [unit does not matter]. 
%               Axes are aligned with the animal's body frame as defined 
%               above.
% sample_freq   1-by-1 scalar, the sampling frequency of the sensor. [Hz]
% wd_static     1-by-1 scalar, window size of the (low-pass) moving
%               average filter, for identifying static portion of the 
%               signal (i.e. fitering out dynamic portion). [counts]
% wd_naive      1-by-1 scalar, window size of the (low-pass) moving
%               average filter, used in the naive method for identifying 
%               portion of the signal associated static and dynamic
%               orientation, fitering out linear accelrations. [counts]
%
% OUTPUT:
% roll          n-by-1 roll angle of the animal in [degree].
%               Roll is defined as the rotation around body forward axis
%               (x-axis). At zero roll, the y-axis has zero gravity
%               reading. Positive roll is body lean to the right.
% pitch         n-by-1 pitch angle of the animal in [degree].
%               Pitch is defined as the angle between body forward axis 
%               (x-axis) and the horizontal plane of the world. 
%               Positive pitch is head up. *NOTE* that positive rotation
%               around y-axis in our axes defination is negative pitch. 
% yaw           n-by-1 yaw angle of the animal in [degree]. The direction
%               of magnetic north is yaw 0. West is 90 deg. South is 180.
%               East is -90 deg.
% A_g           n-by-3 accleration measure (static + dynamic) associated 
%               with gravity. [g]
% A_spec        n-by-3 accleration measure associated with (dynamic) linear
%               accleration of the animal. [g]
% rt            n-by-1 dynamic "pitch" angle of the animal. [degree]
% bool_singular n-by-1 boolean values (0 or 1) indicating whether a point is
%               associated with a singular event (i.e. y-axis colinear with
%               magnetic field). If so, the results for that point come 
%               from the naive method.
